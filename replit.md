## System Architecture
The system is built with a React/TypeScript frontend and a Node.js/Express backend, utilizing Supabase as the primary database.

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui for a modern interface
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design with specific mobile components.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with session management
- **API Structure**: RESTful APIs, including specialized endpoints for mobile access.
- **Middleware**: Custom validation and authentication.

### Database Schema
Key tables include `vehicles`, `maintenance`, `towing_services`, `fuel_cards`, `projects`, and `bases`. It also includes specific tables for external fuel stations (e.g., `abc_v2`, `osasco_v2`), comprehensive audit logging, and junction tables like `project_bases`.

### Key Features
- **Vehicle Management**: Tracking, maintenance scheduling, and real-time status.
- **Fuel Management**: Integration with 13 external fuel stations, mobile-optimized recording, project/base assignment, and receipt management.
- **Towing Services**: Partner management, service request workflows, financial tracking, and external access tokens.
- **Maintenance System**: Service scheduling, workshop management, parts inventory integration, and cost tracking.
- **Mobile External Links System**: Public access forms for fuel stations with mobile optimization, automatic project/base loading, and timezone-aware data entry.

### Data Flow
- **Fuel Station External Access**: Public URLs, mobile device detection, dynamic project loading, data validation, and real-time synchronization.
- **Authentication**: Public access for external forms, Express sessions with Supabase JWT tokens, role-based access (admin, operator, partner), and token-based partner access.
- **Data Processing**: Multi-layer validation, automatic Brazil timezone (UTC-3) conversion, comprehensive audit logging, and performance optimizations.

### UI/UX Decisions
- Modern design using Shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS.
- Consistent color schemes and icons (Lucide React) for visual clarity.
- Sidebar navigation for better organization, especially for base-specific interfaces (e.g., GP03).
- Conditional field displays and responsive layouts to enhance user experience.
- Subtle footer branding for developer attribution.

### Deployment Strategy
- **Environments**: Local development with Replit, production on Replit autoscale.
- **Database**: Supabase cloud hosting.
- **Build Process**: Vite for frontend, Express server for backend, automated schema updates.
- **Deployment**: Replit autoscale with port 5000 mapping and health checks.
